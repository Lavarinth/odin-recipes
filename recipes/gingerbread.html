    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These spicy Italian cookies are the perfect accompaniment for cocoa or coffee during the holiday season! Serve with lemon curd or drizzle with lemon flavored almond bark for a special treat.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup molasses</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons ground ginger</li>
        <li>3/4 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>1/3 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together oil, sugar, eggs, and molasses. In another bowl, combine flours, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg; mix into egg mixture to form a stiff dough.</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half, and shape each half into a roll the length of the cookie. Place rolls on cookie sheet, and pat down to flatten the dough to 1/2 inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove from oven, and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>When cool enough to touch, cut into 1/2 inch thick diagonal slices. Place sliced biscotti on cookie sheet, and bake an additional 5 to 7 minutes on each side, or until toasted and crispy.</li>
    </ol>
